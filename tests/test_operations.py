# tests/test_operations.py

"""
Unit tests for the operations module using pytest.

This test suite covers both positive and negative scenarios for the Operation
class's static methods. It ensures that arithmetic operations perform correctly
and handle edge cases appropriately.

Tests are organized following the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern and adhere
to PEP8 standards for code style and formatting.
