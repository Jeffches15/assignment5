"""
This module provides a professional-grade calculator that can add, subtract,
multiply, and divide numbers based on user input. It leverages the Calculation
classes for operations and includes additional features like help commands and
history tracking to enhance user experience.

This code also demonstrates two common programming paradigms in Python:
- LBYL (Look Before You Leap)
- EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission)

Throughout the code, comments explain where and why these paradigms are used,
providing a comprehensive learning experience for students.

Calculator REPL Help
--------------------
Usage:
    <operation> <number1> <number2>
    - Perform a calculation with the specified operation and two numbers.
    - Supported operations:
        add       : Adds two numbers.
        subtract  : Subtracts the second number from the first.
        multiply  : Multiplies two numbers.
        divide    : Divides the first number by the second.

Special Commands:
    help      : Display this help message.
    history   : Show the history of calculations.
    exit      : Exit the calculator.

Examples:
    add 10 5
    subtract 15.5 3.2
    multiply 7 8
    divide 20 4
