# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Import ABC (Abstract Base Class) and abstractmethod from Python's abc module.
# Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) allow us to define a contract for our subclasses, specifying 
# methods that they must implement. This helps in establishing a standard interface for 
# similar objects without enforcing specific details on how they should work.
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Import the Operation class from the app.operation module. 
# The Operation class is where our basic mathematical functions (e.g., addition, subtraction) are defined.
# Rather than implementing arithmetic logic within each calculation class, we encapsulate it in a 
# separate class to promote modularity. This makes it easier to modify or extend these functions independently.
from app.operation import Operation

# Abstract Base Class: Calculation

class Calculation(ABC):
    """
    The Calculation class is an Abstract Base Class (ABC) that defines a blueprint 
    for all mathematical calculations in the calculator program. This class establishes 
    a consistent interface that all calculation types (such as addition, subtraction, etc.) 
    must follow. 
    
    Why Use an Abstract Base Class?
    - **Abstraction**: By using an ABC, we focus on "what" calculations need to do (execute an operation) 
      rather than "how" each specific operation is implemented. This simplifies our design.
    - **Polymorphism**: By providing a standard interface, any Calculation subclass can be used 
      interchangeably, allowing the program to treat each type of calculation in a consistent manner.
    - **Enforcing Consistency**: The abstract `execute` method enforces that all subclasses implement 
      their own specific version of the calculation logic, making sure that each type of calculation 
      has an `execute` method.

        """
        Initializes a Calculation instance with two operands (numbers involved in the calculation).
        
        **Why Have an Initializer?**
        - This initializer method ensures that each Calculation object will have two numbers (`a` and `b`) 
          to work with, no matter the specific type of calculation.
        - Encapsulating the operands within an instance allows each Calculation object to maintain its own 
          state (values of `a` and `b`), supporting **Object-Oriented Design** principles.

        **Parameters:**
        - `a (float)`: The first operand.
        - `b (float)`: The second operand.

        Abstract method to perform the calculation. Subclasses will provide specific 
        implementations of this method, defining the arithmetic for each operation.

        **Why Use an Abstract Method?**
        - Enforces that each subclass provides its own specific version of `execute`, 
          which is crucial for following the interface defined by Calculation.
        - Abstract methods define "must-have" methods for subclasses. By including `execute` here, 
          we ensure that any class inheriting from Calculation will have this method, making 
          it easier to work with multiple types of calculations in a flexible way.

    The CalculationFactory is a **Factory Class** responsible for creating instances 
    of Calculation subclasses. This design pattern allows us to encapsulate the 
    logic of object creation and make it flexible.

    **Why Use a Factory Class?**
    - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The factory only deals with object creation. 
      This keeps our code organized, as the logic for creating different calculations is 
      separated from the calculations themselves.
    - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: We can add new calculation types without changing 
      the existing codebase. We simply register new calculation classes, making our 
      code extensible and flexible to future modifications.

        **Benefits of Using a Decorator for Registration:**
        - **Modularity**: By using a decorator, we can easily add new calculations by 
          annotating new subclasses with `@CalculationFactory.register_calculation`.
        - **Dynamic Binding**: This approach binds each calculation type to a class dynamically,
